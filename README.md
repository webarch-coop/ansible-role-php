# Webarchitects PHP Ansible role

This Ansible role is designed to install and configure PHP on Debian, by default it installes packages from [deb.sury.org](https://deb.sury.org/), but it can also be used to install and cpnfigure only PHP packages from Debian.

## Role variables

See the [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml) file for the default variables, the [vars/main.yml](vars/main.yml) file for the preset variables and the [meta/argument_specs.yml](meta/argument_specs.yml) file for the variable specification.

## Help

Reinstall a package and the configuration files when they have been deleted (see [serverfault comment](https://serverfault.com/a/670776)):

```bash
UCF_FORCE_CONFFMISS=1  apt-get -o Dpkg::Options::="â€“force-confmiss" install "php8.1-fpm"
```
